# 2009-healthcare-portal
UI for a healthcare portal I designed and developed for an Alfresco WCM and Java/Pega Systems back end. 
This is the front end and all of the related files needed for cross browser back to IE6.

However, some of the libraries - such as the js used to modify the radio buttons (CSS 2)

This was also the main set of files that we used to "break up" and add to the WCM (Alfresco)
