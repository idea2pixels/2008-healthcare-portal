 <p>
		  During an asthma attack, the airways swell and narrow. This makes it hard to
		  breathe. Asthma is a lifelong problem, but it does not have to limit you. If
		  you take charge of your asthma, you can lead a full and active life.</p> <p>There are two parts to taking charge of asthma:</p> <ul><li> Controlling asthma over the long term. You and
			 your doctor can make a daily treatment plan that helps reduce the swelling of
			 your airways and prevent attacks. Using a daily treatment plan also helps you
			 keep track of your asthma and know how well your treatment is
			 working.</li> <li> Treating attacks when they occur. An asthma action plan
			 can help you prevent and treat attacks.</li></ul> <p>If you or your child has been recently diagnosed, it may
		  seem like there is a lot to remember. But the things you need to do to take
		  charge of your asthma are really quite simple. With some practice, they will
		  become part of your normal routine.</p><div class="HwActionset"><a name="What"> </a><div class="HwActionsetSection HwActionsetOpen" id="ActionsetWhat"><div class="HwActionsetHeader"><dl><dt><a class="HwLinkShowActionset" href="#What">What?</a></dt><dd><a class="HwLinkShowActionset" href="#What">What do you need to take charge of your asthma?</a></dd></dl></div><div class="HwActionsetExtra"> </div><div class="HwActionsetContent"><div class="HwActionsetInner">

 <p>There are a few tools you can use to keep track of your asthma and know
		  how well your treatment is working. Keeping track of your asthma lets you act
		  quickly to stop an attack before it becomes an emergency. Your doctor and
		  asthma educator can help you make the plans and learn the skills you need.
		  </p> <p>A <b>daily treatment plan</b> tells you what
		  controller medicine to take every day and when to take it. Controller medicine
		  is usually an inhaled

		  day helps reduce the swelling of your airways and prevent attacks.</p> <p>Your treatment plan may also include:</p> <ul><li> A list of your
			 <a href="http://www.healthwise.org/p_demo/81xhtmlus/content/frame/hw161500.html#hw161500-sec">asthma triggers</a>—the things that make your asthma
			 worse. Avoiding triggers can help you keep your asthma under
			 control.</li> <li> Treatment goals. Having personal goals can help motivate
			 you to follow your plan. For example, goals might include being symptom-free at
			 night or being able to play sports.</li> <li> An
			 <a href="http://www.healthwise.org/p_demo/81xhtmlus/content/frame/ug2519.html#ug2519-sec">asthma diary</a>. In the diary, you write down your peak
			 flow, what symptoms you are having and what caused them, and any medicines you
			 used. See a

    .</li></ul> <p>An <b>asthma action plan</b> can help you
		  make quick decisions about treatment when your asthma is worse and you need to
		  prevent an attack. It tells you:</p> <ul><li> How to know when your asthma is not in control
			 and how to change your treatment so you can prevent an attack.</li> <li>
			 What to do if an attack becomes an emergency, and where to get medical
			 treatment.</li></ul> <p>You and your doctor will work together to create your
		  asthma action plan. An action plan has zones that are based on your peak flow
		  or symptoms. See a

 <p><b>Follow your daily treatment plan</b></p> <ul><li> Take your daily medicines as prescribed. This

		  personal best measurement by 0.80. For example, if your personal best peak flow
		  is 400, then 80% of that is 400 times 0.80, which is 320. To figure what 50% of
